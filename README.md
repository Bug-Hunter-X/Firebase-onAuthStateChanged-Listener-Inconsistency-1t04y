# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: inconsistent triggering across various platforms and network conditions. This issue can result in the application's UI and logic not correctly reflecting changes in the authentication state. 

The `authBug.js` file reproduces the problem, while `authSolution.js` provides a robust solution incorporating error handling and multiple state checks to improve reliability. 

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary Firebase dependencies (refer to `package.json`).
3. Set up your Firebase project and configuration. 
4. Run `authBug.js`. Observe inconsistent behavior in state updates, particularly under conditions of intermittent network connectivity or across different devices or browsers.

## Solution

The `authSolution.js` file implements a more resilient solution using retry mechanisms and additional state management to ensure reliable tracking of authentication changes.
