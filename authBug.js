The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger consistently across different platforms or network conditions.  This can lead to unexpected behavior where authentication state changes are not reflected in the app's UI or logic.  For example, a user might successfully log in, but the app doesn't recognize the authentication state change, keeping the UI in a logged-out state.  Another example is when the app goes offline, then comes back online, the listener might not be properly updated. This is especially problematic with offline capabilities, where a listener for changes to the offline cache isn't reliably triggering.
